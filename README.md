# hoff-bayesian-statistics

These are fairly comprehensive R Markdown lecture notes for [Peter D. Hoff, "A
First Course in Bayesian Statistical
Methods"](http://www.stat.washington.edu/people/pdhoff/book.php), completed as
part of a 1-semester independent study course.

While I covered Chapters 1-10, only Chapters 1-8 are complete right now. They
tend to be quite comprehensive for the earlier chapters, then become more terse
as the chapters grow in length and complexity.

I also tackle some of the exercises at the end of each chapter.

As a small final project, I also implemented R code for the basic binary
relation version of the Infinite Relational Model, described in [Kemp et al.
(2006), "Learning Systems of Concepts with an Infinite Relational
Model"](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Kemp-etal-AAAI06.pdf).
