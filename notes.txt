Van Horn (COX's theorem)

F(y) CDF = P(Y < y)

density f(y) = d/dy F(y)

P(Y \in I) = \int f(y) I(y) *over measure I

CDF - F(y)

PROBABILITIES NOTATION NOTATIONSo

p(y) = P(Y = y)

p is used for PMF AND PDF

two variables:
F(y_1, y_2) = P(Y_1 <= y_1, Y_2 <= y_2)

The joint density of two varables
f(y_1, y_2) = double partial integrals \partial^2 / \partialy \partial y_2 F(y_1, y_2)

Recover joint CDF by integrating over
To recover, integral, integraet from =infty to y_1 and y_2 (double integral over the range)

De Finetti's thieorem - clarify infinitely exchangeable

PUT FORMULAS INTO WIKIPEDIA

Continuous doesn't mean uncountable - just lke an interval

HDP - don't mention higher probability, mention higher DENSITy
DENSITY VS PROBABILITIY
